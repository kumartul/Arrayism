Contributions are always welcome! Before sending a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), make sure that your [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) has not been already fixed or implemented. To contribute, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) Arrayism, [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) all your changes, and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Pull Requests
For addition of more features or bugfixes or implementing faster algorithms, please modify the releveant files. Unit tests are a must. Include them in `test\unit_testing` directory as a part of your pull request. Unit test files should be named `[filename].test.js`.

**Note:** Before running the tests, make sure you have installed the latest version of [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). To learn how to use Jest, you can read [this](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). You need to run the unit tests from command line using `npm test`.

## Programming Guidelines
There are some conventions that I want to follow while contributing to this project:
- **Spacing and Indentation:** Use tabs for indentation
- **Naming**: Variable names must be self-explanatory. Try to avoid special characters while naming the variables
- **Quotes**: You can use whatever you want :)
- **Comments**: Try to use single-line comments most of the times

**Note**: Try to write code in the latest version of JavaScript
